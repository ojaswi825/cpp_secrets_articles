How to install Poco C++ libraries on Ubuntu (Linux)?

The Poco C++ Libraries are powerful cross-platform C++ libraries for building network- and internet-based applications that run on desktop, server, mobile, IoT, and embedded systems.
The Poco C++ libraries are cross-platform are designed to be Scalable, Modular, Robust and Easy to use.

Now let's begin installing Poco libraries in Ubuntu:

Step 1: Start a terminal session (launch terminal) by Ctrl + Alt + T.

Step 2: Install essential dependencies and git, execute the following commands one by one:

$ sudo apt upadate
$ sudo apt upgrade
$ sudo apt install build-essential gdb cmake git


Step 3: Install necessary dependencies,  execute the following commands one by one:

$ sudo apt-get install openssl libssl-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libiodbc2 libiodbc2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev


Step 4: Get root access:

$ sudo -i

enter your Ubuntu password.

Step 5: Navigate to /tmp/ directory (or any other directory to store temporary files).

$ cd /tmp/


Step 6: Clone the Poco git repo:

$ git clone -b master https://github.com/pocoproject/poco.git


Step 7: Compile the libraries:

$ cd poco
$ mkdir cmake-build
$ cd cmake-build
$ cmake ..
$ cmake --build . --config Release

Note: If you get a library not found error, just install that library via apt.

Step 8: Install the libraries to include in C++ code:

$ sudo cmake --build . --target install


The libraries will be installed at /usr/local/include/

Step 9: Test the installation:

A) Copy the following code in a text editor and save it as pocoTest.cpp

#include<iostream>
#include<Poco/HashSet.h>

int main(void) {

    Poco::HashSet<int> hs;

    hs.insert(5);
    hs.insert(7);
    hs.insert(4);
    hs.insert(8);
    hs.insert(9);

    for (auto& i: hs) {
        std::cout << i << " ";
    }
 
    std::cout << endl;

    return 0;
}


B) Compile and run:

$ g++ pocoTest.cpp -o pocoTest
$ ./pocoTest


The output should be:

8 9 7 4 5


Step 10: A brief look on installation:
A) Navigate to /usr/local/include

$ cd /usr/local/include


You will find Poco directory here. Go to Poco directory.

$ cd Poco/


Here you will find a file named HashSet.h

The g++ compiler looks for libraries in include folder by default. So we have to explicitly mention the relative path of libraries we want to use.
That  is why we have used "#include<Poco/HashSet.h>" instead of just "#include<HashSet.h>"
Look for the path of header file you want to use in Poco directory or reference website mentioned at the top.
We also have to look for the namespaces like Poco::HashSet mentioned in the above program.

Now you can start your development using the Poco C++ libraries.
